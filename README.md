# Items-Maintence-System
I worked on this project, as a semester's final project in the "Database System &amp; Design Course" in the third year of my undergraduate degree. As a group of two, I have been working on the user interface and database connections and integrations.
This project is based on SQL for databases, Java swing library for UI and pure Java for functionality management.
